* Agent:

- The entity that perceives its environment and acts upon the environment.

* state:

- A configuration of the agent and its environment.

* Actions:

- Actions are the just choices that can be made in the state.

- Actions will return the set of actions that can be executed in that state.

* Transition model:

- A description of what state results from performing any application action in any state.

- Result(s, a) returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s.

* State space:

- The set of all states reachable from the initial states by any sequence of actions.

* goal test:

- way to determine whether a given state is a goal state.

* path cost:

- numerical cost associated with a given path.
